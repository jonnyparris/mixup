#Mixup

###the idea
Think secret santa gift giving, but for music makers instead.

1. You submit a pack of stems to a track you created to a circle of producers (like names in a hat).
2. You receive a pack of stems at random from the circle.
3. You create beautiful new remix with those stems.
4. On the deadline (e.g. xmas day!), you both send and receive some sweet new musical creations.
